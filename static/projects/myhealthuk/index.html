        I have been scouted by Smartpoint Application Management Systems to work on their project (MyHealthUK) as they were looking for a young local talent which would fulfil their very specific requirements. <br> The experience I have gained has not
        only taught me about working in a team but also about being flexible and adaptable.

        My Health UK is an interactive platform for primary care to engage with patients.
        <br> The goal of this platform is to provide an extra layer of communication between patients, nurses, and their doctors.
        <br/> Patient side of the platform consisting of a mobile app, which allowed patients to receive messages, submit their vitals, request as well as accept appointments. Staff side of the platform provided a web interface that allowed the clinicians
        to interact with patients, in a way never done before. Clinicians had access to patient details, could monitor their patient's vitals, send and book appointments, and also build a library of information to be accessible to the patients.

    <p>
        Working at Smartpoint AMS have taught me a lot, especially considering that we have worked as a small team and the amount of responsibilities was exceptionally high for each of the team members, working there have taught me to organise and prioritize
        my tasks properly as well as quickly respond to the issues.

        Working with web design opens the doors to a lot of dynamic technologies, each of those with its distinct set of adventages and disadventages. During this project I have learned a lot about those, and how to utilise those appropiately. The core framework
        was created with usage of the Laravel framework, which implements full MVC relationships and allows the ORM models to be created in utilised in an easy manner (which saves you a lot of time writing SQL queries)
