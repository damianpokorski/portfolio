    <p>I have created Insulin Rush as one of my assignments. It is a simple resource management game in which player takes a role of a diabetic, and is forced to carefully take control of his/hers character as there's only a limited amount of moves available
        till player runs out of energy.</p>

    <p>Creation of this game involved creating a DirectX 9 Engine from scratch, luckily our tutors provided us with a plethora of resources which have allowed everyone in the class to create a basic engine. We were free to change and adjust the contents
        of the engine as we have seen fit, which allowed me to freely customise the and optimise the engine. </p>

    <p>Certain games focus on realistic situations, for example Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015: Do You Still Shower With Your Dad (2015) focuses on an absurd yet entirely possible situation, on the other hand games like Skyrim (2011) tend to emphasis
        classic fantasy setting in which the protagonist (obviously the prophesised chosen one) has to fight the horde of dragons which threatens to destroy world. In this game I have decided to mix two of these approaches and create an exaggerated setting
        with relatively simple concept that is relatable yet set in a fantastic environment, also having a simple concept allows this game to be a reasonable and achievable project.</p>

    <p>Mechanic of projectiles which are actively chasing their target have been used in multitude of titles, usually set in a futuristic environment, for example Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (2014) allows player to use Homing Rockets in order to destroy
        their targets in an easily manner, but what about less advanced items having ability to pursue their targets? Perfect example of such mechanic has been demonstrated by the House of Flying Daggers (2004) in which the knives are changing path of
        their flight according to intent of the characters, almost exact mechanic can be observed in Wanted (2008) in which the protagonist learns to control the path of the bullets from Angelina Jolie. I think this mechanic fits perfectly with the theme
        of a game – nightmare, as the player is endlessly pursued by inanimate objects.</p>

    <p>Last mechanic that has to be addressed is referred to as “Quick-time events” (QTE for short), which are the Achilles heel of some games, according to Grayson (2015) “...many video game QTE are kinda garbage” because they are often both unexpected
        and borderline impossible to land, or extremely repetitive. However certain games can be entirely based on QTEs and stay successful, for example – Guitar Hero (2005) is game entirely based on timing with only a few inputs, but it does not become
        repetitive due to the complexity of each song and the presentation which is not similar to the traditional way QTEs are presented. For the reasons stated above I have decided to implement a QTE mechanic within the combat “system” of the game.</p>

    <p>Working on this game have been an enjoyable experience, I have polished up my programming, as I seemed to have the problem utilising and understanding the pointers because my preferred programming language is C# and the way these are used is very
        different.
    </p>

    <p>Working through the worksheets have been a learning experience even though it have been tedious and slightly hand leading, I would prefer to be left with tools required for the engine building, such as how to load textures, models, sounds, etc. but
        without the worksheets being filled with exact code I needed to build the engine, I am just more of a hands-on person.</p>

    <p>Worksheets have helped me immensely in the implementation of the base engine features, but I had to alter a lot of engine flow to implement the game in the way that seemed a lot more reasonable to me. One of the first changes I made to the engine
        logic and an implementation of a simple collision which allowed my objects to collide and stopped player controller from clipping through the walls. I have then proceeded by separating all of the logic that was contained in the main file, to gain
        some clarity and speed up my future workflow, as the cluster of various objects being created and stored in the main file seemed hard to comprehend. </p>

    <p>Separation of the engine and game logic allowed me to implement multiple screens quite easily, as well as switch between the game states, I have used this to add various game states to the game (start screen, level selection, game logic etc.) which
        have added a lot more work to do for me, but I think it made the finished product feels more like an actual game instead of it being a tech demo. Implementation of menus has revealed an unusual behaviour – due to the Xbox input not being implemented
        with a button-release recognition, pressing X in one menu instead of putting the player on the next screen it made software go through all of the screens. This behaviour made me realise that I had to improve the Xbox input class unless I wanted
        to use mixed set up controls (X to confirm on screen A, Start to confirm on screen B, etc.). Implementation of this behaviour have been quite easy but it still took the precious time I knew I did not have. </p>

    <p>Once I was able to implement a few base game mechanics, I have realised that the game was incredibly easy to complete, as well as extremely short. While I did not plan for this game ever to be anything other than the presentation of my programming
        skills, it still was a bit of a disappointment. Also, the graphics could use a little bit more fidelity; in hindsight, the game I have designed during this first assignment of this unit could be a bit more complicated. On the contrary, I have
        managed to achieve all of the features that I have designed as well as a few that I have not foresighted, which is an achievement in itself. I also regret implementing only two levels, but the time constraints have stopped me from adding more,
        also due to the lack of mechanics with the game, adding more levels would not increase the fun factor of the finished product, as additional levels would contain the game mechanics.</p>

    <p>To summarise, this unit has allowed me to improve my programming skills significantly; sadly the DirectX 9 API is slightly outdated as it released in 2002, and thus I believe I will not have a chance to showcase this skill in the industry. If I was
        able to use any premade engine for this software development project I believe my efforts would have been more streamlined and I would be able to achieve a lot more, and create a higher quality product.
