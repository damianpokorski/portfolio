        After acquiring the funding required for the proper development, Gamecan decided to employ me as their lead programmer, as I was the most familiar with their concept and the mechanics that they were aiming for. And while the team did not consist of a
        lot of other developers, I believe this role allowed me to not only improve my programming skills but also develop my interpersonal skills.

        As previously mentioned Overstep is a multiplayer FPS game, heavily inspired by old-school fast paced games, with focus on allowing the players to traverse the environment in a fluid and seamless manner and use the surroundings to their advantage. Below
        there's a little snippet of out product which was presented on Kickstarter.

    <p>
        As previously mentioned the project have attempted to gain funding through the Kickstarter, which allowed the entire team to know exactly where we stand regarding the deadlines etc. This was a major part of the development as the awareness of the upcoming
        deadline of existing funding have managed to motivate the team to the unexpected extent. I do consider it very impressive that given such a short amount of time we have managed to produce a marketable product.

        Developing video games is one of my favourite things, as the instant result and ability to tweak with the environment are unlimited.
    </p>

    <p>Below is some early development footage of my two favourite mechanics. I really love games which allow the rapid fully controlled movement to be executed by the player, which is why I found the 'wallrunning' a really enjoyable mechanic.</p>

    <p>Sadly the Kickstarter campaign has not managed to prolong the funding of the project which forced me to look for other opportunities, and leave the team (with great regret, sadly I've got bills to pay :/ ). </p>
    <p>I did enjoy my team I have spent with the team greatly and if given another opportunity I would gladly join a games development if the project idea caught my attention.</p>
