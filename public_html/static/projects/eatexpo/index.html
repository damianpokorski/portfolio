    <p>I have been commissioned to create a custom CMS which will streamline the organisation process of an Expo. It was an interesting experience which allowed me to learned a lot more about web development than I would have expected.</p>

    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom:15px">
        <div class="col-md-5">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
            <h4 style="text-align:center;">Development</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-5">
            <hr>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>At the start of the project I have not been experienced with most of the tools I have deemed right for this project: CodeIgniter was a mystery, jQuery was hazy and PureCSS looked like a miracle. After All I was a self-taught webdesigner/webdeveloper
        at the time.</p>

    <p>After a few long meeting I have established the base line with the client, I knew what exactly would I need to implement: a simple data aggregation with usage of MySQL database and HTML/PHP front-end. It also helped that the client was set on the
        functionality, probably because he already eyed a few features from "competing" sites...</p>

    <p>The development of the CMS itself was a streamlined process, every time I have made a significant modification I've updated my client on the progress, received the feedback and implemented it. I have spent/wasted a lot of the time due to not being
        skilled with usage of PureCSS (think Bootstrap but not as advanced), and I had to patch up my mistakes with the in-line styles. </p>

    <p>I have spent over a hundred hours on this piece of software. It was an amazing opportunity and I would gladly continue to work on it if only the client has not decided that I do not need to get paid for my services, then paying me within 24 hours
        of shutting down the website.</p>

    <p>Another major issue with this client was that my opinion was never considered and it was either his-way-or-the-highway situation when it came to the design. As anyone can see, the design is rudementary(at best), the colour scheme is hideous (yellow
        and green were the requirements!) which I've managed to salvage a bit, but not much.</p>

    <p>This window into freelance-web-development industry allowed me to realise that I was not cut out for the freelancing job, I do greatly preferred a well organised and structured approach where I do not have to deal with the client directly, and am
        always able to rely on my peers etc. This realisation allowed me to focus on my studies and set entering the software-development-industry as my goal.</p>
