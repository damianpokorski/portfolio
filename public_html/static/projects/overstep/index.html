    <p>I have learned a lot during my work experience @Gamecan, not only about the Unreal Engine and the networking logic within it, but also about responsibilities, time management and teamwork. I have been told to log all of my experiences in form of a
        blog. Feel free to check it out. <a href="https://damianpokorski.wordpress.com/">https://damianpokorski.wordpress.com/</a> </p>

    <p>Overstep is a Choose to Pay (Free to play) Multiplayer Only First Person Shooter where the gameplay dynamics change as abruptly and as unexpectedly as the climate itself, forcing the player to adapt or be scrapped. Overstep will be free to download
        and can be played without spending any money at all, however, players will also be given the choice to buy certain in-game cosmetic products to change the visual appearance of their Plodders and weapons, or obtain certain items faster. These purchases
        will not impact gameplay and once players reach the maximum level in the game, they will all be on equal footing and can compete for leaderboard rank. Patient and determined players can obtain every single item in the game without spending any
        money (this will be even faster on the Xbox One version of the game). Overstep will never become a pay-to-win game.</p>

    <p>As a part of my course, each one of us has to complete at least a 100 hours of work experience, which meant that at the start of the year everyone in my class a little bit anxious about this unit. Luckily we have been presented with an opportunity
        to apply for an actual indie development in the late October</p>

    <p>Out of everyone in my class (~20 people), only 4 students have decided to apply, as the application/audition process involved the creation of a little demo which had a few of the features mentioned in the game design document. </p>

    <p>While my demo allowed me to join the company as an intern I have to admit that my demo was the shortest and the least impressionable of all of the demos, on the other hand, the features I've implemented were actually functional, while my classmates
        just created placeholders which looked like they worked but in reality they did not. Also, my demo used networking while all of their demos were in a single player. </p>

    </div>

    <p>After being accepted into the team, I have been told that the company expects us to merge features within the demos that we have created, not a good idea and it took us (interns) a lot of the time to convince the management that it is not possible
        to achieve due to the fact that all of our demos were not compatible with each other (mine was the only one that utilised networking) after that the management decided to use my demo as a base for their game. Which I found particularly odd as
        it turned out the company decided to switch from Unity engine to Unreal Engine, which meant that when we have joined the company had no in-game-content done at all.</p>

    <p>Due to the project being organised over the network the entire management structure was utilised through the medium of trello, which is basically an online board filled with lists of tasks and people assigned to them. As interns, we have been given
        freedom of picking and implementing features we have deemed ourselves the most interested in.</p>

    <p>Working with GameCan was definitely an amazing experience which taught me a lot about the ins and outs of the game development. I have also learned a lot of management by observing how the things are run there which will definitely become a valuable
        experience especially if I ever want to run my own company.</p>
