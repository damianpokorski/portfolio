        Working with Voiteq has allowed me a learn a lot of skills and abilities and also get a taste of a more corporate and official environment. With an Agile oriented development process focused on utilising test driven development I have been able to not
        only improve my skills greatly on a technical side but also learn a lot about the development of a reliable product.

    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>
        As a part of Software Development team I am responsible for a number of tasks on a weekly basis. Currently there are multiple projects that I am part of, and my development skills have increased greatly due to the flexibility that is expected of me. I
        am working with multiple techonlogies and development approaches on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working with the test driven development is quite a new development approach as none of my previous jobs have utilised it. I do believe that is it extremely useful, as it allows establishing the automated testing suites, which then evaluate the integrity
        of code.

    <h3>Receiving - Project Athena</h3>

    <p>
        Goal of this project is to provide the link between the database, the web management console and a mobile device that utilises python engine in order to process voice input and with the web api. Working with this project allowed me to experience a lot
        of well
    </p>

    <p>
        Receiving, is definitely one of the most complicated projects I have ever worked with. Visual Studio solution itself consists of about 30 different projects, each organised into groups and namespaces. It utilises the Inversion of Control as well as many
        design approaches that I was unfamiliar with, but now that I have had a bit of a look I can understand the reason why those are there.

    <h3>Automated deployment</h3>
    <p>
        This is an interesting one. I am tasked with the continuing development of the already established set of scripts which automate the deployment of the product to the customers. The technologies utilised here are : a large pile of Git, Jenkins, powershell
        scripts, dotnet core, unit testing, Azure Cloud services, OctopusDeploy. Our deployment process utilises a fairly complex multistage path:

                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
        Over all I have developed a taste for DevOps with this being my main responsibility. I have developed a fair understanding and abilitity to automate most of the tasks (I even managed to automate Tableau workbook publishing, which was fairly tricky). I
        guess I have a knack for automating things,

    <h3>Dashboard</h3>
    This is my pet project, I have come up with it myself in order to enhance our business procedures. This dashboard allows us to monitor live customer sites, and determine whether their system is correctly process the data and measure the system health.

    This was developed with usage of <strong>Vue.js</strong> which I have grown to adore. It just makes the web development so much easier.

    <h3>Sales Demo</h3>
    <p>
        So due to the fact that I have only started quite recently (4 months now), I have been eased into the world of warehouse software slowly. My initial task was to develop a set of additional functionalities to an in-house software which was used during
        the product presentations. This particular project allows the creation of data sets through the web interface (ASP.NET, DevExpress, EntityFramework) which is converted into QR codes which in turn are sent to the device.

    <h3>Android Development</h3>
    <p>
        I have beent asked with providing a concept protype for a voice operating in-store replenishment software. That itself allowed me to first hand experience working with Android SDK and JAVA. I really like JAVA, also working with IntelliJ instead of Visual
        Studio appeals to me for some unknown reason. I guess I just like the refactoring tools more. My protype implemented a voice recognition of predefined phrases(0-9, help, yes/no, etc.).
